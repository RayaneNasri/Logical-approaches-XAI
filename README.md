# Logical-approaches-XAI
This repository contains the Python code I developed during my research internship at LIP6. The code focuses on implementing and analyzing logical approaches to Explainable AI (XAI). It includes various scripts and modules aimed at enhancing the transparency and interpretability of symbolic machine learning models.
